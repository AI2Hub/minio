# AGPLv3 Compliance

We have designed MinIO as an Open Source software for the Open Source software community. This requires applications to consider whether their usage of MinIO is in compliance with the GNU AGPLv3 [license](https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/master/LICENSE).

MinIO strongly recommends consulting with experts in copyright law and licensing as part of your determinations around compliance.
While MinIO cannot provide this determination for you, you can always reach out to us at hello@min.io to discuss your application's usage and further steps.

[MinIO Commercial Licensing](https://min.io/pricing) is the best option for applications that trigger AGPLv3 obligations (e.g. open sourcing your application). Applications using MinIO - or any other OSS-licensed code - without validating their usage do so at their own risk.
